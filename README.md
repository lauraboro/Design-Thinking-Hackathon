# Design-Thinking-Hackathon

In this repo you will find all the Information regarding the Bili Hackathon 2024 of Group 3 (Noemi, Dominik and Laura).

We are working on case 2 "Smart Homes" and focusing on the problem that many people don't have a lot of time for household chores and have problems remembering all the things they have to do.

Our solution is a scanner that can be attached to your fridge. You can scan products when you want to add them to your grocery list (e.g., if you notice your milk is running low, you scan it, and it gets added to the list). In the grocery list app, you can also order all the items from your preferred store.

With this scanner, it becomes easier to directly add items to your grocery list, so you donâ€™t forget them while doing something else. The ability to order items directly from the list also saves a lot of time, whether grocery shopping or placing the order yourself.

You can find all the products and important info in the [wiki](https://github.com/lauraboro/Design-Thinking-Hackathon/wiki)
